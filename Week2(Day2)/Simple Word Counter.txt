CLASS WordCounter

    METHOD countWords(articleText)
        1. Split the articleText into words
        2. Normalize each word (convert to lowercase, remove punctuation)
        3. Use Stream API with Collectors.groupingBy(word, counting()) 
           to build Map<String, Integer> where
               Key = word
               Value = frequency
        4. RETURN the frequencyMap
    END METHOD

    METHOD findMostFrequentWord(frequencyMap)
        1. Use stream() on frequencyMap.entrySet()
        2. Find entry with maximum value
        3. RETURN that word and its count
    END METHOD

    METHOD findRareWords(frequencyMap)
        1. Use stream() on frequencyMap.entrySet()
        2. Filter where count == 1
        3. Collect results into a List<String>
        4. RETURN list of rare words
    END METHOD
